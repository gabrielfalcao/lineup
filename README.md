# LineUp - Distributed Pipeline Framework for Python

Lineup is a redis-based
[pipeline](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(software)) framework
that turns horizontal scalling seamless.

It's currently providing parallelism through python threads and is
pretty useful for writing systems where the workers make lots of
network I/O.

It scales horizontally, so you can simply run more workers in as many
machines you want.

## Installing

```bash
easy_install curdling
curd install lineup
```

## Philosophy

Lineup focus in:

1. Simplicity: easy to create otherwise complex pipelines
2. Easy-scale: just run more workers and you're good.

## Defining steps

Steps must always implement the method `consume(self, instructions)` and
always call `self.produce()` with it's portion of work.


### Example: a pipeline that downloads files

This is a copy of the [examples](examples) folder.

```python
import re
import codecs
import requests

from lineup import Step


class Download(Step):
    def after_consume(self, instructions):
        self.log(
            "Done downloading %s",
            instructions['url'],
        )

    def before_consume(self):
        self.log("The downloader is ready")

    def consume(self, instructions):
        url = instructions['url']
        method = instructions.get('method', 'get').lower()

        http_request = getattr(requests, method)
        response = http_request(url)
        instructions['download'] = {
            'content': response.content,
            'headers': dict(response.headers),
            'status_code': response.status_code,
        }
        self.produce(instructions)


class Cache(Step):
    def after_consume(self, instructions):
        self.log("Done caching %s", instructions.keys())

    def before_consume(self):
        self.log("The cacher is also ready")

    def get_slug(self, url):
        url = re.sub(r'^https?://', '', url)
        url = re.sub(r'\W+', '-', url)
        return url

    def consume(self, instructions):
        url = instructions['url']
        name = self.get_slug(url)
        with codecs.open(name, 'wb', 'utf-8') as fd:
            fd.write(instructions['download']['content'])
            fd.close()
            instructions['cached_at'] = {
                'filename': fd.name,
            }
        self.produce(instructions)



# Defining pipelines

from lineup import Pipeline

class SimpleUrlDownloader(Pipeline):
    name = 'downloader'
    steps = [Download, Cache]
```

## Command line


When running from the command line, lineup will recursively try to
import all python files given as `--working-dir` argument, which
defaults to the relative equivalent to `os.getcwd()`.

In other words it will find your stuff automatically in dir you run
the pipeline from, or from the `--working-dir` arg.

Type `lineup --help` for more info.


### Running a pipeline in foreground

```bash
lineup downloader run --output=rpush@example-output
```

![example/run.png](example/run.png)


### Feeding a pipeline through command line

```bash
lineup downloader push {"url": "http://github.com/gabrielfalcao.keys"}
```

![example/run.png](example/push.png)

### Feeding a pipeline programatically

```python
from lineup import JSONRedisBackend
from example.pipelines import SimpleUrlDownloader

pipeline = SimpleUrlDownloader(JSONRedisBackend)
pipeline.input.put({
    "url": "http://github.com/gabrielfalcao.keys"
})
```

### Stopping all running pipelines

This broadcasts a "stop" signal in the backend.


```bash
lineup downloader stop
```
